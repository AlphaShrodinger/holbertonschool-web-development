# Webpage Implementation - HTML Structure Only

## Project Overview

In this and future projects, you will implement a webpage from a designer file. The primary goal is to replicate the structure and layout of the design using **pure HTML**. **CSS and other styles** are not required in this phase. You will focus entirely on creating the **HTML semantic structure**.

For this first project, your task will be to implement the webpage's **HTML structure only**, without worrying about styling or visual design.

### Project Requirements
- **No CSS or Styling**: Focus purely on the HTML structure.
- **HTML Semantic Elements**: Use semantic HTML elements to ensure proper accessibility and structure.
- **Figma Designer File**: The webpage design will be provided through a Figma file. You are expected to replicate the structure exactly as shown.

### Tools
- **Figma**: The designer file will be shared with you on Figma. You can view and inspect the design to understand the layout and structure.
- **HTML**: You'll use only HTML to create the webpage structure.
